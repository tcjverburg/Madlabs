## Application of MadLibs.
“Mad Libs” are short stories that have blanks called placeholders to be filled in.
In the non-computerized version of this game, you ask someone to fill in each of the placeholders without telling them anything about the overall story. 
Once all placeholders are filled in, you show them the resulting silly story.
